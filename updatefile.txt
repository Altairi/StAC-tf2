        "Notes"     "If you notice players getting kicked for exceeding processing time, feel free to raise this value, and StAC should respect it and leave it alone."
        "Notes"     "- Updated cvar check to check for host_timescale == 1, see https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/3911"
